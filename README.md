# Grid-Load-Optimizer
This project is an AI-driven simulation tool designed to optimize electrical grid stability. It uses predictive modeling to forecast peak demand periods and simulates the dynamic redistribution of energy loads to prevent brownouts. By balancing renewable input with consumer consumption, the software serves as a "Digital Twin".
